# Project Proposal

## High-Level Goal
Build a Shiny app that generates a personalised Spotify Wrapped-style report using Spotify listening data collected from students and online.

## Goals and Motivation
Our project aims to create a customised version of Spotify Wrapped that reflects the most updated actual listening habits of users. The main focus will be the genres they listen to most frequently.

The motivation for this project comes from feedback from friends and peers who felt that last year’s official Spotify Wrapped did not accurately represent their music tastes. This was due to Spotify's budget cuts where they lay off extensive staff and used AI tools to develop 2024 Wrapped. By using and improving our visualisation techniques learned in our Data Visualization course, we hope to create a more precise and satisfying experience for music listeners.

This project is interesting because it combines real-world data collection, data cleaning, and interactive visual storytelling with our shared interest in music. It addresses the problem of inaccurate or overly simplified summaries of personal music preferences generated by AI alone for a massive group of stakeholders, by offering a transparent and customisable alternative.

We plan to gather data from both online sources (e.g., public Spotify datasets) and voluntary submissions from classmates and friends (in Australia and Vietnam). This approach allows us to validate whether the visual outputs align with users’ perceptions of their own music listening habits.

## Weekly Plan

| Week | Task | Team Member(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Team meeting: Plan the project, set up GitHub, decide what features the Shiny app will have. | Hai, Samantha |
| 2 | Collect Spotify data from online sources (Hai); Collect Spotify data from friends in Australia and Vietnam (Samantha); Clean and format data in R (both). | Hai, Samantha |
| 3 | Write R scripts to extract genre and artist info from data (Hai); Write R scripts to summarize top songs, artists, and total listening time (Samantha); Test R scripts together. | Hai, Samantha |
| 4 | Design the Shiny app layout (Samantha); Link the R data processing code to the Shiny app (Hai); Create basic plots (Samantha); Add filter/search options for users (Hai). | Hai, Samantha |
| 5 | Finish the Shiny app; Sammantha makes the presentation slides; Hai makes a short demo video; Test the app with friends and get feedback. | Hai, Samantha |

> **Disclaimer**: Until we can contact the remaining team member, Le Nguyen Gia Binh, we have temporarily assigned tasks between Hai and Samantha. We will redistribute and assign appropriate tasks to Le Nguyen Gia Binh once he is available.
