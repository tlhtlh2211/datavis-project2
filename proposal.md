# Project Proposal

## High-Level Goal
Build a Shiny app that generates a personalized Spotify Wrapped-style report using collected Spotify listening data from students and online sources.

## Goals and Motivation
Our project aims to create a customized version of Spotify Wrapped that better reflects users' actual listening habits, focusing especially on the genres they listen to most.

The motivation for this project comes from feedback from friends and peers who felt that this year’s official Spotify Wrapped did not accurately represent their music tastes. By developing our own visualization using techniques learned in our Data Visualization course, we hope to create a more precise and satisfying experience for users.

This project is interesting because it combines real-world data collection, data cleaning, and interactive visual storytelling. It addresses the problem of inaccurate or overly simplified summaries of personal music preferences by offering a transparent and customizable alternative.

We plan to gather data from both online sources (e.g., public Spotify datasets) and voluntary submissions from classmates and friends. This approach allows us to validate whether the visual outputs align with users’ perceptions of their own music listening habits.

## Weekly Plan

| Week | Task | Team Member(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | Team meeting: Plan the project, set up GitHub, decide what features the Shiny app will have. | Hai, Sammantha |
| 2 | Collect Spotify data from online sources (Hai); Collect Spotify data from friends (Sammantha); Clean and format data in R (both). | Hai, Sammantha |
| 3 | Write R scripts to extract genre and artist info from data (Hai); Write R scripts to summarize top songs, artists, and total listening time (Sammantha); Test R scripts together. | Hai, Sammantha |
| 4 | Design the Shiny app layout (Sammantha); Link the R data processing code to the Shiny app (Hai); Create basic plots (Sammantha); Add filter/search options for users (Hai). | Hai, Sammantha |
| 5 | Finish the Shiny app; Sammantha makes the presentation slides; Hai makes a short demo video; Test the app with friends and get feedback. | Hai, Sammantha |

> **Disclaimer**: Until we can contact the remaining team member, Le Nguyen Gia Binh, we have temporarily assigned tasks between Hai and Sammantha. We will redistribute and assign appropriate tasks to Le Nguyen Gia Binh once he is available.
