# Project Proposal

## High-Level Goal
We aim to build an interactive Shiny app that generates a personalised "Spotify Wrapped"-style report using real Spotify listening data collected from students and online sources. The app will focus primarily on analysing and visualising users’ most-listened-to music genres, artists, and overall listening patterns.

## Goals and Motivation
Our project aims to create a customised version of Spotify Wrapped that reflects the most up-to-date, real listening habits of users. The main focus will be on the genres and artists they listen to most frequently.

The motivation for this project comes from feedback from friends and peers who felt that last year’s official Spotify Wrapped did not accurately represent their music tastes. Typically, Wrapped provides its 675 million users with an interactive display of genre stories, cultural comparisons, music-personality quizzes, and location-based taste matches. However, the 2024 Wrapped lacked much of the human-like creativity it was known for, instead displaying basic lists of artists and songs (often with inaccuracies) and an AI-generated podcast. By applying the visualisation techniques we have learned in the Data Visualization course and developing our skills further, we hope to create a more precise and satisfying experience for music listeners.

This project is interesting because it combines real-world data collection, data cleaning, and interactive visual storytelling with our shared interest in music. It addresses the problem of inaccurate or overly simplified summaries of personal music preferences generated by AI alone for a massive audience, by offering a transparent and customisable alternative.

We plan to gather data from both online sources (e.g., public Spotify datasets) and voluntary submissions from classmates and friends in Australia and Vietnam. This approach will allow us to validate whether the visual outputs align with users’ perceptions of their own music listening habits.

## Weekly Plan

| Week | Task | Team Member(s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
