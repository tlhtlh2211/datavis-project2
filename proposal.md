# Project Proposal

## High-Level Goal
Build a Shiny app that generates a personalized Spotify Wrapped-style report using collected Spotify listening data from students and online sources.

## Goals and Motivation
Our project aims to create a customized version of Spotify Wrapped that better reflects users' actual listening habits, focusing especially on the genres they listen to most.

The motivation for this project comes from feedback from friends and peers who felt that this year’s official Spotify Wrapped did not accurately represent their music tastes. By developing our own visualization using techniques learned in our Data Visualization course, we hope to create a more precise and satisfying experience for users.

This project is interesting because it combines real-world data collection, data cleaning, and interactive visual storytelling. It addresses the problem of inaccurate or overly simplified summaries of personal music preferences by offering a transparent and customizable alternative.

We plan to gather data from both online sources (e.g., public Spotify datasets) and voluntary submissions from classmates and friends. This approach allows us to validate whether the visual outputs align with users’ perceptions of their own music listening habits.
